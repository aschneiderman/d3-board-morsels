<h1>D3 Board Morsels</h1>
<p> Techniques for Using D3 to Create a BoardGame-Like Resource Management Tool.</p>

<h2>SVG Icons in an SVG Area</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There are 2 ways to work with SVG icons: <a href="manipulate-svg-icons/icon-simple.html">Inline</a> or
<a href="manipulate-svg-icons/icon-simple2.html">create it from scratch</a></li>
  <li>There are also 2 ways to create multiple SVG icons: <a href="manipulate-svg-icons/icons-copy-html.html">copying and pasting the HTML</a>, which is quick but doesn't work with IE, and <a href="manipulate-svg-icons/icons-from-scratch.html">creating all of the icons from scratch</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Up Next</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maybe try storing the icon in a g, with an outer g that handles the transition?  That way, don't have to worry about weirdo transform issues -- especially since most icons, cards, etc. will have multiple parts, such as titles.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tiles Using Divs</h2>
<p>Can use external icons, images, etc. Can also use anything that uses HTML, such as the  <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> CSS Framework, which also gets you responsive design without a lot of work.
  Might also give us a cleaner way of doing Queues and maps that doesn't require a lot of math (although to be fair, the math for simple SVG maps, for example, is pretty straightforward).
  Doesn't give you the degree of control that SVG does â€“ e.g., any shape you can think of, you can create; gradients.

<h2>Cards</h2>
<p>Up Next</p>
<ul>
  <li> Instead of using icons, try playing with contrasting colors</li>
  <li>Try playing with creating cards -- rounded rectangles with areas that have text</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tiles Using SVG</h2>
<p>Gives you huge amount of control. Also gives you anything SVG can do, including gradients and other funky affects (not that it's clear we need those affects). But have to use math to position everything exactly, and may be limited in using icons -- may eat up too much processing power</p>
