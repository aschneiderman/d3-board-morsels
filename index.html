<h1>D3 Board Morsels</h1>
<p> Techniques for Using D3 to Create a BoardGame-Like Resource Management Tool.</p>

<h2>Icons</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="manipulate-svg-icons/icon-simple.html">Icon Test 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="manipulate-svg-icons/icon-simple2.html">Icon Test 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="manipulate-svg-icons/icon-simple3.html">Icon Test 3</a>: copying and pasting HTML doesn't work with IE!  Need to try another approach -- turn into "getIcon" function?</li>

</ul>
<p> A thought:  maybe for our version, we do it using the build-each-time  approach, since there shouldn't be a ton of them, we encapsulate it so it's not a huge deal, then we ask folks for help.  </p>
<p>Also, wait until we know what we actually want to do, <i>then</i> worry about it if we need the technique. </p>

<p>Would it bother me if I only had to deal with one path? Nope, it would make sense.  So why is multiple paths such a big deal?  I think I need to just let this one go.</p>
<h2>Up Next</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Try playing with creating cards -- rounded rectangles with areas that have text</li>
  <li>ing: aybe try storing the icon in a g, with an outer g that handles the transition?  That way, don't have to worry about weirdo transform issues -- especially since most icons, cards, etc. will have multiple parts, such as titles.</li>
</ul>
