This example is from my blog on how to [Create a Gooey effect during a transition](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2015/05/gooey-effect.html) and shows multiple gooey circles coming out of a center stationary circle and then falling back in

The other two examples

- [Gooey appearing from a circle](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/f6952f1ef900d84be918)
- [Gooey falling out of a rectangle](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/a3684c52fb527c8fa415)

You can find even more gooey examples in my follow-up blog [More fun data visualizations with the gooey effect](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2016/06/fun-data-visualizations-svg-gooey-effect.html)
