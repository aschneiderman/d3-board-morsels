This example is from my blog on how to [Create a Gooey effect during a transition](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2015/05/gooey-effect.html) and shows a gooey circle appearing from a bigger stationary circle

The other two examples

- [Gooey falling out of a rectangle](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/a3684c52fb527c8fa415)
- [Multiple gooey coming out of a center and then falling back in](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/69808ec7ec07542ed7df)

You can find even more gooey examples in my follow-up blog [More fun data visualizations with the gooey effect](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2016/06/fun-data-visualizations-svg-gooey-effect.html)
