This example was used in my blog on [Creating real-life based motion effects in d3.js visuals](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2016/05/real-life-motion-effects-d3-visualization.html), which is part of the [SVGs beyond mere shapes series](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2016/04/svg-beyond-mere-shapes.html)

This is a simple example of applying motion blur to SVG circles.
They are both undergoing the same motion blur at the same time, but only one of them is also moving while this happens

Other examples about motion blur are
